# digital-dungeon-masters-screen
python desktop application built as an excercise
this version is discontinued and a c# version will be developed starting soon*

# Current Features:
## Dice Roller
Inlcludes the standard array of d4 through percentile tabletop game dice.  Currently only rolls one at a time, once per click but rolling a variable amount will be supported some time in the future
## Peasant Names
Generates names that can reasonibly be used even for common folk.  Only generates a first name with no title.  You don't have to reroll countless times to get a decent common name; something other than "Lord Wihelm The Third" or "Brycium Janshualem"
